<ul>
<li>General convention of naming files and variables:</li>
</ul>
<p>All files with <strong>run</strong> as prefix are driver script for a particular computation All files with <strong>func</strong> as prefix are functions and can be called from a script or the command line. Check if it has global variables(not the best practice, so I use it sparingly).</p>
<p>In my scripts, there is a compromise between descriptive variable naming used in traditional programming and mathematical programming which uses standard scientific notation to write equations. When possible, I have tried using the former approach to make the piece of code transparent and readable while, the functions developed by the earlier authors may differ.</p>
