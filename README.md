README file for using the partial control sculpting codes

General convention of naming files and variables:
---
All files with **run** as prefix are driver script for a particular computation
All files with **func** as prefix are functions and can be called from a script
or the command line. Check if it has global variables(not the best practice, so 
I use it sparingly).

In my scripts, there is a compromise between descriptive variable naming used 
in traditional programming and mathematical programming which uses standard 
scientific notation to write equations. When possible, I have tried using the 
former approach to make the piece of code transparent and readable while, the 
functions developed by the earlier authors may differ.
