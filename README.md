README file for using the partial control sculpting codes

General convention of naming files and variables:
---
All files with **run** as prefix are driver script for a particular computation
All files with **func** as prefix are functions and can be called from a script
or the command line. Check if it has global variables(not the best practice, so 
I use it sparingly).
